  <h3>Books and Teaching</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>D. Easley, J. Kleinberg. Networks, Crowds, and Markets: Reasoning About a Highly Connected World. Cambridge University Press, 2010.
      This book is based on an inter-disciplinary course that we teach entitled Networks. The book, like the course, is designed at the introductory undergraduate level with no formal prerequisites. To support deeper explorations, most of the
      chapters are supplemented with optional advanced sections.</li>
    <li>J. Kleinberg, E. Tardos. Algorithm Design. Addison Wesley, 2005.
      This book is based on the undergraduate algorithms course that we both teach. We also use the more advanced parts for our graduate algorithms course.</li>
